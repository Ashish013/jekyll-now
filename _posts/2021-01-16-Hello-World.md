I'm currently pursuing my batchelors degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at IIIT Naya Raipur. I love writing codes that automizes workflows and gets rid of the scut work, enabling people to work on the things that matter the most and boost productivity. I also love to teach, interact and guide the new comers in the field.

*This blog helps me to document my learnings and lead the way to the people in the future on this path.*

## Research Interests

I'm an avid learner with my reserach interests being Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
I love to read and implement associated research papers. Other than that I'm also trying my hands on NLP and Reinforcement learning.
So hence ocassionaly I'll be writing up an explanation blog on topics that people often misunderstand in NLP and Reinforcement learning.

My Research Interests are summarized as follows:
* Image Analysis and Object localization
* Facial Recognition
* Video Analytics using Deep Learning
* General Adversial Networks 

## Technolgies and Skills
* Programming Languages - Python, C++, Matlab
* Libraries - scikit-learn, OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tkinter
* Framewrorks - TensorFlow, Pytorch
* Mark-up Languages and Tools - Git, HTML, CSS, Latex

## Teachings
* Session 2 - Intorduction to Google Colabratory
* Session 3 - Intorduction to Numpy

## Non-Academic Intersts and Achievements

Other than academics I'd like to invlove myself in playing sports such as Roller Skating, badminton, swimming and cricket.
Speaking of Roller Skating I've participated in States Competition (Telangana - 2016) and like to skate whenver I'm free.

I also am fond of cinematography/directing short films and have directed 2 short films in past, both of which I'm not very proud of :grimacing:

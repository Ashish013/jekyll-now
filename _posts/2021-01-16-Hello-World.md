## About me

I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at IIIT Naya Raipur. I love writing codes to train Deep Learning and Machine Learning models. You can find me mostly active on Twitter and Github. Other than that, I also enjoy teaching, interacting and directing newcomers in the field.

*The main motive of this blog is to help me document my learnings.*

## Research Interests
My current research interests include Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I love reading and implementing the relevant research papers in these areas. Most of the time I'll be thinking of ways to implement them to actual real life problems ❤. Somrtimes, I also like to get interested in a bit of Natural Language Processing.

**Interested research topics:**
* Image Analysis and Object localization
* Facial Recognition
* Video Analytics using Deep Learning
* General Adversial Networks 

## Technolgies and Skills
* Programming Languages - Python, C++, Matlab, C, Java
* Libraries - scikit-learn, OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tkinter
* Frameworks - TensorFlow, Pytorch, Unity
* Tools - Git, Latex, Command prompt

## Teachings
* [Session 2 - Intorduction to Google Colabratory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pRPKMKj8_avTAqneWBHVXGvTaVZNHGWt?usp=sharing)
* [Session 3 - Intorduction to Numpy](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pRPKMKj8_avTAqneWBHVXGvTaVZNHGWt?usp=sharing)

## Non-Academic Intersts and Achievements

Other than academics, I like to be involved in sports such as Roller skating and badminton. Speaking of roller skating, I've participated  and won several acclodes in district and state wide Roller skate tournaments. I also seldom like to involve myself in a bit of filmmaking.

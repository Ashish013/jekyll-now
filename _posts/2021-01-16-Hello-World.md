## About me

I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at IIIT Naya Raipur. I love training Deep Nets and truly believe that ML/DL can have a profound impact on the daily on goings of people. I can mostly be found following geeks on Twitter or surfing code and reading blogs on GitHub. Other than that, I also enjoy teaching, interacting and directing newcomers in the field.

*The main motive of this blog is to help me document my learnings along the way.*

When I'm not training models and being a geek, I like to roller skate or watch a few space documentaries and follow up on future space endeavors and technologies and sometimes even try out some filmmaking. 

## Non Academic Achievements

Speaking of space, our entry in the NASA Ames Space Settlement contest had won a consolation prize with over 4000 students participating world wide that year. Our idea included a ten torus mega structure located around the orbit of Mars with each torus being designed for a specific purpose.

And also being an avid roller skater, I've participated and won several accolades in the district and state wide roller skate tournaments that I really look  back to and cherish.

## Research Interests

My current research interests lies in the domain of Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I love reading the relevant research papers in these areas, and try to think of ways to implement them to actual real life problems. Some of the other domains that excite me include Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning and Astronomy.

**Interested research topics:**

* Image Analysis and Object localization.
* Facial Recognition.
* Video Analytics using Deep Learning.
* General Adversial Networks.

## Technologies and Skills

* Programming Languages - Python, C++, Matlab, C, Java.
* Libraries - Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* Frameworks - TensorFlow, Pytorch, Unity.
* Tools - Git, Latex, Command prompt.

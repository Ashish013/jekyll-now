## About me

I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at IIIT Naya Raipur. I love writing code that automates workflows and gets rid of scut work, allowing people to work on things that matter most. Other than that, I also enjoy teaching, interacting and directing newcomers in the field.

*The main motive of this blog is to help me document my learnings*

## Research Interests
My current research interests are Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I enjoy reading and implementing the relevant research papers in these areas. Most of the time I'll be thinking of ways to implement them to actual real life problems :love:.When I'm free, I also like to get interested in a bit of Natural Language Processing.

**Interested research topics:**
* Image Analysis and Object localization
* Facial Recognition
* Video Analytics using Deep Learning
* General Adversial Networks 

## Technolgies and Skills
* Programming Languages - Python, C++, Matlab, C, Java
* Libraries - scikit-learn, OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tkinter
* Frameworks - TensorFlow, Pytorch, Unity
* Tools - Git, Latex, Command prompt

## Teachings
* [Session 2 - Intorduction to Google Colabratory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pRPKMKj8_avTAqneWBHVXGvTaVZNHGWt?usp=sharing)
* [Session 3 - Intorduction to Numpy](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pRPKMKj8_avTAqneWBHVXGvTaVZNHGWt?usp=sharing)

## Non-Academic Intersts and Achievements

Other than academics, I would like to be involved in sports such as Roller Skating, badminton, swimming and cricket. Speaking of roller skating, I participated in the Telangana Roller Skate Competition in 2016 and, also secured first place twice in the District Roller Skate Tournament.

I also seldom like to involve myself in a bit of filmmaking.

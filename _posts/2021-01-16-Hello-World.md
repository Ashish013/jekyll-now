## About me

I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at IIIT Naya Raipur. I love writing code that automates workflows and gets rid of scut work, allowing people to work on things that matter most. I also enjoy teaching, interacting and directing newcomers in the area.

*This blog helps me document my learning and guide people on this journey in the future.*

## Research Interests

I'm an inquisitive learner who's interested in Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I enjoy reading and implementing relevant research papers in these areas.
When I'm free, I also like to get interested in a bit of Reinforcement Learning. So, sometimes, I'm also writing blogs on subjects that beginners often misunderstand in them.

**My Research Interests are summarized as follows:**
* Image Analysis and Object localization
* Facial Recognition
* Video Analytics using Deep Learning
* General Adversial Networks 

## Technolgies and Skills
* Programming Languages - Python, C++, Matlab
* Libraries - scikit-learn, OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tkinter
* Frameworks - TensorFlow, Pytorch, Unity
* Tools - Git, Latex, Command prompt

## Teachings
* [Session 2 - Intorduction to Google Colabratory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pRPKMKj8_avTAqneWBHVXGvTaVZNHGWt?usp=sharing)
* [Session 3 - Intorduction to Numpy](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pRPKMKj8_avTAqneWBHVXGvTaVZNHGWt?usp=sharing)

## Non-Academic Intersts and Achievements

Other than academics, I would like to be involved in sports such as Roller Skating, badminton, swimming and cricket. Speaking of roller skating, I participated in the Telangana Roller Skate Competition in 2016 and also secured first place twice in the District Roller Skate Tournament.

I also seldom like to involve myself in a bit of filmmaking/directing short films.

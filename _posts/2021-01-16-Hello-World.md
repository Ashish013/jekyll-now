## Non-Academic Intersts and Achievements

Other than academics I'd like to invlove myself in playing sports such as Roller Skating, badminton, swimming and cricket.
Speaking of Roller Skating I've participated in States Competition (Telangana - 2016) and like to skate whenver I'm free.

I also am fond of cinematography/directing short films and have directed 2 short films in past, both of which I'm not very proud of 😬
